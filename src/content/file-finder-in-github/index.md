![File finder in Github](./asset-1.png)

Lately, When I was spending time on Github I found one of the interesting feature in Github. File finder.

File finder is very much inspired from modern text-editors like SublimeText, Atom. And it uses fuzzy search. :)

It’s very easy to activate. Just press **t** anywhere in your repo.

Thank you for reading
