Hey guys,

I always wanted to start an open-source project that helps people to learn something new and help them collaborate with others

So lately, I started a small Github project for people who are excited about React.

Here’s the link:  
 [https://github.com/srebalaji/Todo-er](https://github.com/srebalaji/Todo-er)

The main aim of the project is to bring people together to build a simple todo app in React.

I’m making sure that this project is (React) beginner friendly so that people who are learning React or in the beginner stage can come together to contribute

However, everyone is welcome to contribute to the project.

Happy Hacking :)
