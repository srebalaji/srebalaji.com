Hey Devs


I'm starting a tutorial series to learn Go from scratch.

This series will help people to learn the language from scratch and will be covering advanced topics.

Lately, I was reading about learning in public. So I thought of just trying this out in small steps.

And I will be updating all my notes in my blog.

Let's see how it goes :) :)
